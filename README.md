All tags, gecko code or not, are tied to a community. Mostly so we could see who created it. Originally, Gecko Code Tags were only intended to be added under the ProjectRio community, comm_I'd 1 as you noted. The intention there was so that we could restrict who could add them so we could be sure they worked and avoid "rio is broken" for bad tag codes.

But then we decided to allow people to add gecko code Tags to their own communities with the understanding that we won't help debug non official gecko code tags

Tags from one community can be used in any TagSet though. We wanted people to watch a stream and make their own TagSets with the same rules without everyone making Tags for the same rules.
